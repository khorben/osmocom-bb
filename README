This repository is a fork from osmocom-bb's master branch.

The primary focus is to make it work for myself, meaning:
- with a regular NetBSD-based toolchain (and compilation environment)
- targetting the Openmoko Freerunner (GTA02) in particular, fully embedded
- facilitate integration with external C programs using osmocom for telephony

All bugs added by Pierre Pronchery <khorben@defora.org>.
